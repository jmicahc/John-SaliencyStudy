Scripts in this directory are relatively straightforward.
There are only two:

    1. order_generator.py:
         - Creates a file called ordered_trials.txt
           according to all the constraints we
           discussed. The ramdomization code is
           actually in Stimuli_Tool module which was
           supposed to be copied into your site-packages
           directory. Modifications to the constraints
           will have to be made to Stimuli_Tool.py, and
           only after a thorough understanding of the
           code. Otherwise, for changes on constraints you
           can ask me. Note that as this script stands,
           it will fail ~85% of the time, since innitial
           randomization often makes meeting constraints
           impossible.

  2. experiment.py:
        - This is just a python implementation of the
          same experiment created in Tobbi Studio. 
          It is very simple.
