The scripts in this directory are related to analysis of
saliency and subject data. Some of them are dependant on
the output of others. Thus, these scripts can be described
in the format of a workflow (you'll have to excuse the
bad names for things):


    1. Subject_Data_Analysis.py (in Subject_Data):
        - This extracts the fixation data from the
          .csv files and generally formats the data
          for processing elsewhere. This is first
          in the pipeline.

    2. Vertices_Tool.py:
        - This is a tool used to interactively define interest 
          areas on images. This should be run second to create 
          a file called polygon_data.txt to be used by other 
          scripts.

    3. saliencyAnalysis.py:
        - This takes the data from polygon_data.txt and computes
          the total heat in each polygon. This is the big 
          bottle-neck in the workflow as it runs extremely slow 
          (~3 hours on my comp). 

    4. heatAnalysis.py:
        - This takes the output from saliencyAnalysis.py
          (polygon_data2.txt) and computes relative and 
          absolute proportions. See the file for more details.
          Should be run after a polygon_data2.txt file has
          been generated by saliencyAnalysis.py.
    
    5. analysis_main.py:
        - This is the final analysis script used to generate
          all the data to be plotted. It was developed in a
          bit of a rush and perhaps is more complicated than
          it needs to be. However, it is commented throughout,
          so maybe it is inteligible. It makes saliency and
          subject objects and databases with several funtions 
          to allow for comparative analyses on arbitrary subsets 
          of conditions.


All of the scripts have comments containing more details. There are some
bugs in the workflow (mostly to do with low-level pygame errors) that
will need to be handled manually and creatively as they come up.
